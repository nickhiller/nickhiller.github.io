                    <span class="start">In late 2012</span> I began working with the Spencer Brewery to develop their new brand from scratch. The brewery is run by the Trappist monks at St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts. The monastery has been in existence for over 200 years, and in 2012 they began construction on a new brewery project, America's first official Trappist brewery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I first met with them, they were in the very early stages of their venture: they were building a brewery and were developing a recipe. Beyond that, they had not gone deep into what their brand would be.

            Over the course of the next 3 months I met with the monks at their monastery in Spencer, learning as much as I could about them and their way of life. Once I felt I had a handle on who they were and what they were hoping to achieve, I got to work writing a brand brief that would act as our guide for the next stages of development.
        </p>
        <p>
            In writing the brief, I identified brand elements drawn from the abbey itself: the abbey's shield, a font pulled from the abbey's stone altar, their fleur-de-lis, their colors, the abbey bell tower.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then found examples of other brands that I felt embodied the look and feel that would work well for the Spencer packaging. Simplicity and humility were central, and I found that our look was better defined by wine than most of the craft beer on the market.

    <h2>Brand Design Process</h2>
    <p>
        With our brief in hand, the next step was to hire a design firm that could bring our vision to life. After interviewing and receiving proposals from designers all over the country, I opted for a local Austin firm, <a href="http://helmsworkshop.com/">Helms Workshop</a>, as the best fit.
    </p>

    <p class="caption">An early packaging design mockup by Helms Workshop. You <a href="http://helmsworkshop.com/case-studies/study/6/">read their case study of the process</a> to learn more.</p>
    <p>
        Over the course of the next 2 months, we worked with Helms to refine the concept, whittling away until we had a solid foundation from which to base all further brand collateral. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, we arrived at a look that was strikingly close to what we had originally outlined in the brief, the perfect embodiment of what the brewery hoped to accomplish.

    <h2>Brand Extension</h2>
    <img src="../a/img/extension.png">

<div class="wrapper sm-wrapper">
    <p>
        Once we had our packaging for the first beer, Spencer Trappist Ale, we next needed to develop line extension options for future beers the brewery hoped to produce.

    <h2>Glassware</h2>

    <p class="caption">Early mockups of the glassware informed the final product</p>

<div class="wrapper sm-wrapper">
    <p>
        Next up was the glass. All Trappist breweries serve their beer in a unique chalice. It is crucial to the presentation and enjoyment of a Trappist beer. From a technical standpoint the volume of the glass needed to match the bottle, 11.2 fl. oz. It also needed to serve certain tactile functions such as conveying a preserving the aroma, the feel of the glass in the hand, brand recognition, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        After speaking with the brewmaster about the specific concerns he had regarding the glass's performance (his primary concern was the aroma and clarity) I got to work. Once I had the brewery's go ahead with my design, I began reaching out to different glass manufacturers, in the U.S., Germany, and Canada, to see if they felt the glass was something they could deliver. I ultimately went with America's #1 glass manufacturer, Libbey Glass. After working with their technicians in Germany, the end product was the Spencer Chalice.

    <h2>Tap Handle</h2>

<div class="wrapper sm-wrapper">
    <p>
        Tap handles are an important opportunity to gain brand visibility in the crowded and often dimly lit draft bar setting. We knew that the handle would be on tap alongside many other craft beer handles with much bigger and louder imagery, and we needed to standout. The monastery's bell tower is the defining feature of the monastery building, often the first sight people get of the monastery when they are entering the abbey grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        I asked Helms to produce a design that used the bell tower and the end result was the Spencer tap handle.

    <h2>Website</h2>

<div class="wrapper sm-wrapper">
    <p>
        The website needed to serve two primary functionsâ€”tell the story of the monastery and brewery and describe the beer. It was important that it was responsive, for customers at the point of purchase wanting a little more information, was in line with the brand identity. We also needed the site to act as a conduit to both our online store (where people could purchase the glass) and for distributors and media to access the items they needed to promote the brand.

<div class="wrapper sm-wrapper">
    <p>
       With a new brand comes the development of the online presence. I created and ran the Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and newsletter during my tenure.
    </p>
    <p>
       It was important to make the Spencer chalice available to anyone who wanted to purchase it. This served two functions: for those who had purchased the beer, the could enjoy the beer as the brewery intended, and for those in states where the beer would not yet be available, this was a way for them to support the brewery project.
    </p>
    <p>
       Throughout my time with the brewery I opened and ran our online e-commerce store using Shopify's platform and Shipwire's fulfillment service.

    <p>
       To tell the story of the monks in more detail, I produced a documentary film about the day-to-day life of a monk at St. Joseph's. This was a challenge as the monastic life is intentionally closed to the outside world. I had to work in silence and with care, ingratiatingly myself with the subjects and making myself as invisible as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
       During this trip I also shot all of the principle photography of the monastery and monks that would be used on the website and by media outlets who ran our story.
